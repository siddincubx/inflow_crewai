Marco Rossi is a man carved from the rough stone of Neapolitan ambition and a healthy dose of self-regard. At 48, his once-dark hair is now flecked with silver, but his eyes, a stormy grey, still hold the intensity of a man perpetually on the brink of eruption. He moves with a restless energy, his gestures often sharp and emphatic, even when merely ordering an espresso. Marco is a master of the pointed remark and the dismissive wave, quick to take offense and even quicker to ensure his own comfort and gain. He believes the world owes him a debt, and he’s not afraid to remind everyone within earshot.

Personality
Marco's defining traits are his short temper and his unwavering selfishness. He has zero tolerance for inefficiency, perceived slights, or anything that doesn't directly benefit him. A misplaced order at a restaurant or a slow-moving queue can trigger a volcanic outburst, complete with dramatic gesticulations and a torrent of rapid-fire Italian expletives. He views most interactions through the lens of "what's in it for me?" and isn't above cutting corners or manipulating situations to his advantage. Empathy is a foreign concept to Marco; he struggles to understand perspectives beyond his own, often dismissing others' feelings with a scoff or an eye-roll.

His "slight bit offensive" nature isn't malicious, per se, but born from a deeply ingrained insensitivity and a lack of filter. He'll make observations about appearance, intelligence, or even personal choices without considering the impact, often prefacing them with a dismissive "Ah, ma che dici?" ("Ah, what are you talking about?"). He might casually insult a friend's taste in clothing or offer unsolicited, critical advice, believing he's simply being "honest." This bluntness, coupled with his quick temper, means he often leaves a trail of ruffled feathers in his wake.

Appearance
Marco is of medium height, with a stocky build that suggests a fondness for good food, particularly his mamma's cooking. His face is weathered, with deep lines around his mouth from years of scowling and shouting. He often dresses in well-made but slightly dishevelled shirts, usually untucked, and dark trousers. There's a subtle air of unkemptness about him, as if he's too busy pursuing his own agenda to bother with sartorial perfection. He favors a heavy gold chain peeking from beneath his collar, a relic from a more ostentatious past.

Background
Raised in a large, boisterous Neapolitan family, Marco learned early on that the loudest voice often gets heard. This environment, while fostering a strong sense of family loyalty (at least on his terms), also solidified his belief in self-preservation above all else. He's had a string of minor entrepreneurial ventures, each one pursued with initial gusto but often abandoned when the effort outweighed the immediate reward. He's quick to blame external factors for his failures, never himself. His current "business" is often vaguely defined, allowing him maximum flexibility and minimal accountability.

Habits & Quirks
Chain Smoking: A cigarette is almost always between his fingers or tucked behind his ear, a nervous habit that intensifies when he's agitated.

Loud Phone Calls: His phone conversations are public announcements, regardless of his location.

The "Pah!" Dismissal: A sharp, dismissive sound often accompanied by a flick of the wrist.

Food Obsession: Despite his often foul mood, he takes immense pleasure in good food and will become momentarily agreeable if offered a particularly fine meal.

Strengths (if any)
Marco possesses a certain undeniable street smarts. He's shrewd and quick-witted, especially when it comes to spotting an opportunity or navigating a tricky situation to his advantage. He's also fiercely independent, unwilling to be beholden to anyone. These qualities, if tempered with even a shred of altruism, could make him formidable.

Weaknesses
His most glaring weaknesses are his lack of self-awareness and his complete inability to compromise. He struggles to learn from his mistakes because he rarely acknowledges them as such. His short temper alienates potential allies, and his selfishness means he's often isolated when he truly needs help. His offensive remarks, while sometimes unintentional, constantly burn bridges.
